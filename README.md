# File-Management

Project Description

The Dynamic File Organizer is a Python-based script designed to streamline the process of managing files within a directory by automatically sorting them into designated subdirectories according to their file extensions. This solution helps users maintain a tidy and organized digital workspace, facilitating quicker access to files and improving overall productivity.

Functional Overview

Key Features

1) Automated Categorization: The script reads the file extension of each file in a specified directory and categorizes it into predefined groups such as images, documents, audio files, and more.

2) Directory Management: Depending on the file type, the script automatically creates subdirectories (if they do not already exist) and moves files into these organized folders.

3) Customizable Categories: Users can define and customize the categories and their corresponding file extensions through a configuration dictionary, allowing for flexibility depending on the user's specific needs.

Technologies Used

1) Python: The script is written in Python, utilizing its powerful libraries for file and directory management.

2) os and pathlib Modules: These modules facilitate file system operations, such as traversing directories, renaming, and moving files.
